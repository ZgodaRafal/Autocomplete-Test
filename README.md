# Technical Interview Challenge
## Autocomplete

### Goal

For this challenge, you will have to build a simple NodeJS server as well as a simple React application.


**Server**

The server will contain an endpoint returning a list of names.

```
GET https://localhost:8000/api/names
```

List:

```
Roberto,
Stephanie,
Daniel,
Maxime,
Bruno,
Robert,
Douglas,
Sergey,
Kim,
Kenji
```


**React App**

The React application will only contain an input field. When you start typing in this field, we should see a list of matching names appearing below (see screenshot below).
